PROJECT: Automate-PluralSight
StartDate: 27-12-2018
Creator: SRvSaha
Desc: These are subtasks which 
can be done for betterment of
the project
NOTE: Automation of PluralSight
is illegal. Also, it will ban the account
if unusual traffic is found from an account.
Find a workaround to this thing
============================================
Subtask 1 (Easy): BASIC STRUCTURING

As of now, we are passing the directory name directly to the program.

In this case we need to create the folders manually where to save the files.

Ideally, it should be done in this way:

- Fix a base parent directory for the downloads. Like ("E:\IDM") or something. Later on make it in such a way
that it is configurable so that we can keep this parent directory as the name of the Track(Certification Course) 
example: CISCO CCNA Data Centre(See Subtask 5)
- Check if there is any existing folder with the name of the course title
- If it exists, add the downloads there, else create a new directory as a child of the parent dir
- While downloading check if there exists the subdirectory with the module name inside the course dir
- If yes, add in that for the videos those are in the same module
-- If not, create a folder (generally the case of new module) and then add it's videos there

Subtask 2 (Moderate): COMMAND LINE BASED SOFTWARE
Use ArgParse to pass the arguments rather than passing using sys.argv

Write proper help statements, verbose statement for files to be passed and if possible mention
examples

Subtask 3 (Tough): SCHEDULER KIND OF THING WHICH WILL ACT LIKE ALWAYS LISTENING SERVER
Auto Start the Python Script whenever any new .json file comes in. This will help us in a way 
that we don't have to manually start the python script and thereby it'll be the case of Auto
downloading


If possible, try to find a fix for that.

Subtask 4 (R&D): ADVANCED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE REVAMPTION

Write a jQuery function which does this thing:

It will go to the track page like: 
Cisco CCNP Routing and Switching
Then
It will find out all the sections and subsections.

It will output a mapping kind of a file, where we have the mapping like this:

ROUTE (300-101) has 10 courses in it with the names of these 10 courses.

Similarly, it will do for all the available ones.

In this was we will have a file mapping which will give us the mapping hierarchy
and in this way we can create our local directory structure.
As a part of Subtask (1) we are already creating directory by the name of course and the subdirectory
based on module. This is will an extension of it where we will have this kind of directory structure:

CERTIFICATION_NAME or the main name like: Cisco CCNP Routing and Switching
SECTION_NAMES or the name of the subparts of the Certification. These can be some exam names or some 
other names based on logical segregation.
COURSE_NAME will be the name of each course inside that CERTIFICATION_NAME. These will lie under
respective SECTION_NAMES
MODULE_NAME will be the name each of the modules which will be under COURSE_NAME
VIDEO_NAME will be the name of the video which will be under their respective MODULE_NAME. 

Pictorically:

Subtask 5 (R&D): WEBSITE AUTOMATION
Figure out some way to automate the way the jQuery is run in the console which itself is a bit time
consuming considering the copy-paste we have to do.
